# JavaScript-Basics-Review
js codework done to review all basics on TH to be able to start CodeLouisville properly
I am currently learning GitHub and how it works with my computer. 
I actually uploaded things here that go in other places.
Going to try again as I upload my first project file (which is accidentally included here).
At least this shows what I have been doing for the last three weeks, since so much was review on Treehouse, it will not show
as active time there.
All of this activity is based on Treehouse coursework.
